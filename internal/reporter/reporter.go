// Description: See package comment for this one file package.

// Package reporter implements an interface that captures the analysis.Pass.Reportf
// function within it so that it can be wrapped. This provides the ability for consumers
// of the linters exposed in lintroller to explicitly ignore linter errors for the
// linters that report on specific lines by way of nolint directives as well as provide
// the framework within lintroller itself to report lint reports as warnings instead of
// errors for specific linters.
